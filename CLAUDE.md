## References

@docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-cc-coach-design.md **Read when:** planning or
implementing skills for this plugin

## Conventions

- Follow the [cc-plugin-repo-guideline](https://github.com/clever-cc-plugins/marketplace/blob/main/docs/cc-plugin-repo-guideline.md) for all structural decisions
- Skill names match their directory name (kebab-case)
- A cc-coach skill never requires a sibling plugin (cc-career, cc-concept, ...) to be
  installed — it ships a generic domain framework as baseline and opportunistically
  enriches from that sibling plugin's context files when registered. See the design
  doc for the full rationale.

## Don't

- Don't commit secrets or credentials to git
- Don't use `--force` flags — fix the underlying issue instead
- Don't copy skill files into the clever-cc-plugins umbrella repo — it references them via `git-subdir`
- Don't make a coaching skill's core functionality depend on another plugin being installed

## Learnings

When the user corrects a mistake or points out a recurring issue, append a one-line
summary to `.claude/learnings.md`. Don't modify `CLAUDE.md` directly.

## Compact Instructions

When compacting, preserve: list of modified files, current test status, open TODOs, and key decisions made.
